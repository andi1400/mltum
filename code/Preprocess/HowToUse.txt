0. Make sure to delete the erroneous row in the original data set (in line 122078)

1. Download weka from http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/downloading.html (The other platforms version will do it.)

2. Compile with having current weka.jar in classpath
	i.e. javac -cp "/home/ajauch/Downloads/weka-3-6-10/weka.jar:." Preprocessor.java

3. Use it as follows (again you need the weka jar)
	java -cp "/home/ajauch/Downloads/weka-3-6-10/weka.jar:." Preprocessor originalDataSet.csv output
